# Repository of Tooling

A list of resources and tools for modern web development. Mostly a personal list
for me to refer to.

Everything is here for a reason and it's worth researching the tradeoffs between
them. Feel free to ask in more detail.

In the early stages of a project it's important not to get sucked into doing
everything youself. The chances are you need focus on learning about your
users and adapting the product design/features. I try to keep complexity down 
by using tried and tested services that epscialise in each area. Running your own
assets/logging/database/search/API/CMS can be a trap.


## SPA libraries

[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for manipulating the DOM with certainty.

Vue.js for something simpler

re-frame if you dig clojure

Elm


## Styling

[CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) generated classnames scoped to your component.

[SUIT CSS](http://suitcss.github.io) or BEM naming conventions if you can't use CSS modules

[Basscss](http://www.basscss.com) or Tachyons. For a better way of styling
thigs.

Styled Components for styling React components. Patterns [here](https://medium.com/@jxnblk/patterns-for-style-composition-in-react-eb4f5f313e6f#.50ehv21to)

## Pre-processors

ES6 Javascript with Babel


## Frontend Testing

Jest


## Backend

[Prismic](https://prismic.io) hosted CMS

Ruby on Rails for core logic (or indeed code monoliths).

Elixir/Phoenix is great in theory (so long as you're the only one on the project).

Go for services and pipes.

Node for isometric web apps.

[Keystone](http://keystonejs.com) node CMS


## Persistence

PouchDB


## Search

[lunr.js](http://lunrjs.com): Client side search engine


## Third party APIs

Imgix for image hosting and processing

Papertrail for log storage

Error reporting service

[algiola](https://www.algolia.com) for hosted search

## Editor

Standard or AirBnB eslint config
